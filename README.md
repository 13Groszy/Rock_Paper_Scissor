This web app is a simple game which remember users choice (in this case element),
create random computer choices on every button press and compare the cases.
You can either win, lose or draw against AI.
Game is limited to 20 games, to play you must choose the element otherwise you will be reminded to do so.
Elements description appear after the symbol is clicked.
